<h3>Aaron Wile's SignUpForm Assignment</h3>

The SignUpForm App simulates a user-info-gathering page on a website or
mobile app. It has text fields to receive user input for a name, email address,
password, and password confirmation. When the save button at the bottom is clicked,
it checks to see that all fields are filled with some input. It then validates that
the email address is in a valid format, and also that the passwords match. If any errors
in the input are present, it alerts the user to fix these before continuing, like so:

If all checks are passed, it sends a toast to welcome the user to the theoretical app
they are signing up for.
